/// ## Why and when should I use this instead of [`CounterCell`]?
///
/// The `CounterCell::incr_delta()` function is around twice as slow as counting a `usize` integer.
/// This is because we have to copy the cells value, do the arithmetic and write the value back.
/// Usually this is not a problem because it is still a very fast operation. In loops or hot-paths however
/// it can become a considerable overhead we want to avoid as much as possible.
///
/// You should always prefer this over manually counting a loop because we might loose values when returning
/// on an error, early-return or add such code in future and forget to adjust.
///
///
/// ## When to *not* use this?
///
/// Because this writeback counter only writes its values into the original cell when dropped, this is
/// not suitable if you directly need to read from a `CounterCell` within the same scope. This should
/// however avoided as much as possible, because these structures are for collecting measurements and should
/// be read from the initial [`HwMeasurementAcc`].

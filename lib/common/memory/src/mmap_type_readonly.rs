//! Typed read-ponly memory maps
//!
//! This module adds type to directly map types and a slice of types onto a memory mapped file.
//! The typed memory maps can be directly used as if it were that type.
//!
//! Types:
//! - [`MmapTypeReadOnly`]
//! - [`MmapSliceReadOnly`]
//!
//! Various additional functions are added for use within Qdrant, such as `flusher` to obtain a
//! flusher handle to explicitly flush the underlying memory map at a later time.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Code in this module is `unsafe` and very error prone. It is therefore compacted in this single
//! module to make it easier to review, to make it easier to check for soundness, and to make it
//! easier to reason about. The interface provided by types in this module is as-safe-as-possible
//! and uses `unsafe` where appropriate.
//!
//! Please prevent touching code in this file. If modifications must be done, please do so with the
//! utmost care. Security is critical here as this is an easy place to introduce undefined
//! behavior. Problems caused by this are very hard to debug.

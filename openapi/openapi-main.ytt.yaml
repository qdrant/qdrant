    API description for Qdrant vector search engine.


    This document describes CRUD and search operations on collections of points (vectors with payload).


    Qdrant supports any combinations of `should`, `min_should`, `must` and `must_not` conditions,
    which makes it possible to use in applications when object could not be described solely by vector.
    It could be location features, availability flags, and other custom properties businesses should take into account.

    ## Examples

    This examples cover the most basic use-cases - collection creation and basic vector search.

    ### Create collection

    First - let's create a collection with dot-production metric.

    ```

    curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/test_collection' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data-raw '{
        "vectors": {
          "size": 4,
          "distance": "Dot"
        }
      }'

    ```

    Expected response:

    ```

    {
        "result": true,
        "status": "ok",
        "time": 0.031095451
    }

    ```

    We can ensure that collection was created:

    ```

    curl 'http://localhost:6333/collections/test_collection'

    ```

    Expected response:

    ```

    {
      "result": {
        "status": "green",
        "vectors_count": 0,
        "segments_count": 5,
        "disk_data_size": 0,
        "ram_data_size": 0,
        "config": {
          "params": {
            "vectors": {
              "size": 4,
              "distance": "Dot"
            }
          },
          "hnsw_config": {
            "m": 16,
            "ef_construct": 100,
            "full_scan_threshold": 10000
          },
          "optimizer_config": {
            "deleted_threshold": 0.2,
            "vacuum_min_vector_number": 1000,
            "default_segment_number": 2,
            "max_segment_size": null,
            "memmap_threshold": null,
            "indexing_threshold": 20000,
            "flush_interval_sec": 5,
            "max_optimization_threads": null
          },
          "wal_config": {
            "wal_capacity_mb": 32,
            "wal_segments_ahead": 0
          }
        }
      },
      "status": "ok",
      "time": 2.1199e-05
    }

    ```


    ### Add points

    Let's now add vectors with some payload:

    ```

    curl -L -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/test_collection/points?wait=true' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
      "points": [
        {"id": 1, "vector": [0.05, 0.61, 0.76, 0.74], "payload": {"city": "Berlin"}},
        {"id": 2, "vector": [0.19, 0.81, 0.75, 0.11], "payload": {"city": ["Berlin", "London"] }},
        {"id": 3, "vector": [0.36, 0.55, 0.47, 0.94], "payload": {"city": ["Berlin", "Moscow"] }},
        {"id": 4, "vector": [0.18, 0.01, 0.85, 0.80], "payload": {"city": ["London", "Moscow"] }},
        {"id": 5, "vector": [0.24, 0.18, 0.22, 0.44], "payload": {"count": [0]}},
        {"id": 6, "vector": [0.35, 0.08, 0.11, 0.44]}
      ]
    }'

    ```

    Expected response:

    ```

    {
        "result": {
            "operation_id": 0,
            "status": "completed"
        },
        "status": "ok",
        "time": 0.000206061
    }

    ```

    ### Search with filtering

    Let's start with a basic request:

    ```

    curl -L -X POST 'http://localhost:6333/collections/test_collection/points/search' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
        "vector": [0.2,0.1,0.9,0.7],
        "top": 3
    }'

    ```

    Expected response:

    ```

    {
        "result": [
            { "id": 4, "score": 1.362, "payload": null, "version": 0 },
            { "id": 1, "score": 1.273, "payload": null, "version": 0 },
            { "id": 3, "score": 1.208, "payload": null, "version": 0 }
        ],
        "status": "ok",
        "time": 0.000055785
    }

    ```

    But result is different if we add a filter:

    ```

    curl -L -X POST 'http://localhost:6333/collections/test_collection/points/search' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
        "filter": {
            "should": [
                {
                    "key": "city",
                    "match": {
                        "value": "London"
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        "vector": [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
        "top": 3
    }'

    ```

    Expected response:

    ```

    {
        "result": [
            { "id": 4, "score": 1.362, "payload": null, "version": 0 },
            { "id": 2, "score": 0.871, "payload": null, "version": 0 }
        ],
        "status": "ok",
        "time": 0.000093972
    }

    ```

      summary: Discover points
      description: >
        Use context and a target to find the most similar points to the target, constrained by the context.

        When using only the context (without a target), a special search - called context search - is performed where
        pairs of points are used to generate a loss that guides the search towards the zone where
        most positive examples overlap. This means that the score minimizes the scenario of
        finding a point closer to a negative than to a positive part of a pair.

        Since the score of a context relates to loss, the maximum score a point can get is 0.0,
        and it becomes normal that many points can have a score of 0.0.

        When using target (with or without context), the score behaves a little different: The 
        integer part of the score represents the rank with respect to the context, while the
        decimal part of the score relates to the distance to the target. The context part of the score for 
        each pair is calculated +1 if the point is closer to a positive than to a negative part of a pair, 
        and -1 otherwise.
